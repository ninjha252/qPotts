The project attempts to simulate the q-state potts model for a two dimensional square lattice using the
Metropolis algorithm. Different qs correspond to different possibilities for phase transitions. This project
utilizes the Lee Kosterlitz algorithm and the histogram method of extrapolation to predict- whether a
phase transition exists for a given q, and if it exists, characterise it. The results of the code were first
verified using the critical temperature values obtained from analytic results. The phase transitions near
critical temperatures for q = 2, 3, 5, 10 were studied.
